# dig-peer-protocol — Normative Specification

This document is the authoritative contract for the `dig-peer-protocol` crate: the DIG Network
L2 P2P message layer. It specifies the wire framing, the DIG opcode namespace (200–219),
the introducer registration messages, the re-exported Chia protocol surface, and the
invariants an implementation MUST uphold.

The key words MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, and MAY are to be interpreted as
described in RFC 2119.

The README covers usage; this document covers the contract.

## 1. Scope and role

`dig-peer-protocol` is the single import point for DIG P2P messaging. It:

1. Re-exports the Chia protocol ecosystem (`chia-protocol`, `chia-sdk-client`,
   `chia-ssl`, `chia-traits`, `chia_streamable_macro`) so consumers depend on
   `dig-peer-protocol` alone (§6).
2. Defines the DIG opcode band **200–219** as a disjoint extension of Chia's
   `ProtocolMessageTypes` namespace (§3).
3. Defines `DigMessage`, a framing type that is **byte-identical on the wire** to
   `chia_protocol::Message` but carries the opcode as a raw `u8`, so both Chia and DIG
   opcodes can be encoded and decoded (§2).
4. Defines the introducer wire types: the Chia-standard `RequestPeersIntroducer` /
   `RespondPeersIntroducer` (opcodes 63/64) and the DIG-extension `RegisterPeer` /
   `RegisterAck` (opcodes 218/219, DSC-005) (§4, §5).

The crate contains no networking I/O of its own beyond what `chia-sdk-client` re-exports;
it is a types + framing crate.

## 2. Wire framing — `DigMessage`

### 2.1 Byte layout (normative)

Every message on a DIG P2P connection uses the following framing, identical to
`chia_protocol::Message`'s `Streamable` encoding. All multi-byte integers are
**big-endian**.

```
offset  size        field       meaning
0       1           msg_type    raw u8 opcode (Chia 0–107 or DIG 200–219)
1       1           has_id      0x00 = no id; any non-zero value = id present
2       2 (if id)   id          u16 correlation id, big-endian
+0      4           data_len    u32 payload length, big-endian
+4      data_len    data        opaque payload bytes (encoding defined per opcode)
```

- An encoder MUST emit `has_id` as exactly `0x01` when an id is present and `0x00`
  when absent. A decoder MUST treat any non-zero `has_id` as "id present"
  (`from_bytes` tests `has_id != 0`).
- `data_len` MUST equal the exact byte length of `data`.
- A zero-length payload (`data_len == 0`) is a valid message.

### 2.2 Decoding rules

`DigMessage::from_bytes(&[u8]) -> Option<DigMessage>`:

- MUST accept **any** `msg_type` value — no enum validation at the framing layer.
  Opcode dispatch is the receiver's responsibility (§3.1).
- MUST return `None` (never panic, never read out of bounds) when the buffer is
  truncated at any point: shorter than 2 bytes, ends inside the id, ends inside
  `data_len`, or ends before `data_len` payload bytes.
- MUST return `None` when the decoded `data_len` exceeds `DigMessage::MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE`
  (16 MiB), checked BEFORE any bounds check against `bytes.len()` or slicing/allocating
  the payload — a peer-controlled length prefix cannot force an allocation above this
  ceiling. `MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE` mirrors `chia-protocol`'s own message-size limit and is
  comfortably above any legitimate DIG opcode payload.
- `from_bytes` is a leaf parser over an already-materialized `&[u8]`; `MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE`
  bounds only the allocation `from_bytes` itself performs. Callers (the transport/framing
  layer that assembles the byte slice from the wire) MUST enforce their own per-frame
  size cap BEFORE buffering an incoming frame into a contiguous slice, so an oversized or
  lying length prefix cannot force unbounded buffering ahead of ever reaching
  `from_bytes`.
- All internal offset arithmetic (`offset + 2` for the id, `offset + 4` for `data_len`,
  `offset + data_len` for the payload end) MUST use checked addition and return `None`
  on overflow rather than panicking or wrapping. This keeps decoding safe on every
  target pointer width, including 32-bit targets where a peer-controlled `data_len`
  near `u32::MAX` could otherwise overflow a `usize` bounds check.
- Trailing bytes beyond `data_len` are ignored by `from_bytes` (it reads exactly the
  framed length).

`DigMessage::to_bytes(&self) -> Vec<u8>` MUST produce the §2.1 layout exactly;
`from_bytes(to_bytes(m)) == Some(m)` MUST hold for every `DigMessage`.

`DigMessage::from_bytes_owned(buf: Vec<u8>) -> Option<DigMessage>` applies the
identical acceptance/rejection rules as `from_bytes` (same truncation checks, same
`MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE` cap, same overflow-checked offset arithmetic) but takes the buffer
by value and moves the payload range out of it (via `Vec::drain`) instead of copying it
out of a borrowed slice with `to_vec`. Callers that already own a `Vec<u8>` (e.g. a
transport that read the frame directly into an owned buffer) SHOULD prefer this over
`from_bytes` to avoid an extra payload copy; `from_bytes` remains the correct choice
when only a borrowed `&[u8]` is available.

### 2.3 Fields and construction

```rust
pub struct DigMessage {
    pub msg_type: u8,        // raw wire opcode
    pub id: Option<u16>,     // request/response correlation id
    pub data: Bytes,         // serialized payload body
}
DigMessage::new(msg_type: u8, id: Option<u16>, data: Bytes) -> DigMessage
DigMessage::MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE: usize = 16 * 1024 * 1024  // 16 MiB — see §2.2
```

`DigMessage` is `Debug + Clone + PartialEq + Eq`.

### 2.4 Interoperability with `chia_protocol::Message`

- `DigMessage::from_chia_message(&Message) -> DigMessage` — lossless; the enum
  discriminant becomes the raw `u8`. Clones `msg.data`.
- `DigMessage::from_chia_message_owned(Message) -> DigMessage` — same conversion,
  taking `Message` by value and moving `data` instead of cloning it. Prefer this when
  the source `Message` does not need to be kept afterward.
- `DigMessage::try_into_chia_message(&self) -> Option<Message>` — succeeds iff
  `msg_type` is a valid `ProtocolMessageTypes` discriminant; MUST return `None` for
  opcodes the Chia enum does not define. DIG-only traffic stays in `DigMessage`. Clones
  `self.data`.
- `DigMessage::into_chia_message(self) -> Option<Message>` — same conversion and same
  failure condition, taking `self` by value and moving `data` instead of cloning it.
  Prefer this when `self` does not need to be kept afterward.
- Classification helpers: `is_dig_extension()` is `msg_type >= 200`;
  `is_chia_standard()` is `msg_type < 200`. The boundary is exactly 200
  (199 is Chia-standard, 200 is DIG-extension).

## 3. DIG opcode namespace — `DigMessageType` (200–219)

### 3.1 The 200+ convention (normative)

Chia's `ProtocolMessageTypes` occupies discriminants 0–107. DIG opcodes start at
**200**, leaving a ≥92-value gap against future Chia additions. Because `msg_type` is an
untyped `u8` on the wire, a receiver MUST dispatch on numeric value:
`< 200` → Chia handler, `>= 200` → DIG handler.

New DIG opcodes MUST be assigned only within the DIG band starting at 200, contiguously
after `MAX_ASSIGNED`; an assigned opcode MUST NOT be removed, renumbered, or repurposed.

### 3.2 Assigned opcodes (normative registry)

`DigMessageType` is `#[repr(u8)]`; each variant maps 1:1 to its wire value.
`DigMessageType::MAX_ASSIGNED == 219`; `DigMessageType::ALL` lists all 20 variants in
declaration order.

| Opcode | Variant | Delivery strategy | Purpose |
|--------|---------|-------------------|---------|
| 200 | `NewAttestation` | Plumtree eager push | Validator attestation |
| 201 | `NewCheckpointProposal` | Plumtree eager push | Checkpoint proposal from epoch proposer |
| 202 | `NewCheckpointSignature` | Plumtree eager push | BLS signature fragment for checkpoint aggregation |
| 203 | `RequestCheckpointSignatures` | Unicast request | Request checkpoint signatures |
| 204 | `RespondCheckpointSignatures` | Unicast response | Respond with checkpoint signatures |
| 205 | `RequestStatus` | Unicast request | Request peer's chain status |
| 206 | `RespondStatus` | Unicast response | Respond with chain status |
| 207 | `NewCheckpointSubmission` | Plumtree eager push | Aggregated checkpoint after BLS aggregation |
| 208 | `ValidatorAnnounce` | Broadcast flood | Validator directory announcement |
| 209 | `RequestBlockTransactions` | Compact block | Request missing transactions by short ID |
| 210 | `RespondBlockTransactions` | Compact block | Respond with full transactions |
| 211 | `ReconciliationSketch` | ERLAY | Set-reconciliation sketch |
| 212 | `ReconciliationResponse` | ERLAY | Set-reconciliation response |
| 213 | `StemTransaction` | Dandelion++ stem | Privacy-preserving tx origination |
| 214 | `PlumtreeLazyAnnounce` | Plumtree lazy | Hash-only announcement to non-tree peers |
| 215 | `PlumtreePrune` | Plumtree control | Demote sender to lazy |
| 216 | `PlumtreeGraft` | Plumtree control | Promote sender to eager |
| 217 | `PlumtreeRequestByHash` | Plumtree control | Request full payload by hash |
| 218 | `RegisterPeer` | Introducer | Self-registration request (DSC-005) |
| 219 | `RegisterAck` | Introducer | Registration acknowledgement (DSC-005) |

The payload encodings for opcodes 200–217 are defined by their consumers (the gossip
layer); this crate defines the payloads for 218/219 (§4) and the framing for all.

### 3.3 Conversion and error behavior

- `TryFrom<u8> for DigMessageType`: MUST succeed for exactly 200..=219 and MUST fail
  with `UnknownDigMessageType(value)` for every other `u8` (including all Chia values
  and 220+).
- `UnknownDigMessageType(pub u8)` implements `std::error::Error`; its `Display` is
  `"unknown DigMessageType discriminant: {n}"`.
- `Display` for `DigMessageType` renders `Name(value)`, e.g. `RegisterPeer(218)`.

### 3.4 Serde representation (normative)

`DigMessageType` serializes as the raw `u8` discriminant (e.g. JSON `216`), **not** the
variant name. Deserialization MUST accept unsigned and signed integer inputs, narrow to
`u8`, and reject out-of-`u8`-range values ("out of u8 range") and in-range values that
are not assigned discriminants (the `UnknownDigMessageType` message). Non-integer inputs
are a type error ("DigMessageType wire value (u8 in 200..=219)").

## 4. Introducer registration — `RegisterPeer` / `RegisterAck` (DSC-005)

DIG-extension messages by which a node advertises its P2P reachability to an introducer.
Opcodes 218/219 do not exist in stock `ProtocolMessageTypes`, so these types travel as
`DigMessage`, not `chia_protocol::Message`.

### 4.1 `RegisterPeer` (opcode 218)

Payload fields, encoded with Chia `Streamable` in declaration order:

| # | Field | Type | Streamable encoding | Meaning |
|---|-------|------|---------------------|---------|
| 1 | `ip` | `String` | u32 BE length + UTF-8 bytes | Externally reachable IP or hostname |
| 2 | `port` | `u16` | u16 BE | P2P listening port |
| 3 | `node_type` | `NodeType` | u8 discriminant | Declared service role; gossip nodes register as `NodeType::FullNode` |

API:

- `RegisterPeer::new(ip, port, node_type)`.
- `to_dig_message(&self, id: Option<u16>) -> Result<DigMessage, chia_traits::Error>` —
  MUST produce a `DigMessage` with `msg_type == 218`, the given `id`, and the
  Streamable-encoded payload.
- `from_dig_message(&DigMessage) -> Option<Result<Self, chia_traits::Error>>` —
  MUST return `None` when `msg_type != 218` (wrong-opcode is not a decode error);
  otherwise `Some(Streamable::from_bytes(data))`, where a corrupt/truncated body
  surfaces as `Some(Err(_))`.

### 4.2 `RegisterAck` (opcode 219)

Payload: a single `bool` (`success`), Streamable-encoded as one byte. A body that is
empty or otherwise not a valid bool encoding MUST decode as `Some(Err(_))`.

`success == false` is a **valid wire outcome** meaning the introducer rejected the
registration by policy; it MUST NOT be treated as a transport or decode error.

API mirrors §4.1: `RegisterAck::new(success)`, `to_dig_message(id)` (opcode 219),
`from_dig_message` (`None` unless `msg_type == 219`).

### 4.3 Registration exchange

1. The node sends `RegisterPeer` (typically with a correlation `id`) declaring
   `ip`, `port`, `node_type`.
2. The introducer replies `RegisterAck { success }`, echoing the correlation semantics
   of the framing layer (§2.1). `success == true` means the peer was accepted into the
   introducer's directory; `false` means a policy rejection.

## 5. Chia-standard introducer types (opcodes 63/64)

`RequestPeersIntroducer` (opcode 63, empty body) and `RespondPeersIntroducer`
(opcode 64, body = `Vec<TimestampedPeerInfo>` in Chia Streamable list encoding) are
declared with `#[streamable(message)]` because their opcodes exist in stock
`ProtocolMessageTypes`. They implement `ChiaProtocolMessage` and therefore work with
`chia_sdk_client::Peer` request APIs directly; they MUST remain byte-compatible with
the upstream Chia introducer protocol.

## 6. Re-exported surface (public API contract)

Consumers MUST be able to obtain the following through `dig_peer_protocol::*` without
importing the underlying crates:

| Source crate | Re-exported |
|--------------|-------------|
| `chia-protocol` | everything (`pub use chia_protocol::*`): `Message`, `Handshake`, `ProtocolMessageTypes`, `NodeType`, `Bytes`, `TimestampedPeerInfo`, … |
| `chia-sdk-client` (always) | `load_ssl_cert`, `ClientError`, `Network`, `Peer`, `PeerOptions`, `RateLimit`, `RateLimiter`, `RateLimits`, `V2_RATE_LIMITS` |
| `chia-sdk-client` (TLS-gated, §7) | `Client`, `ClientState`, `Connector`; `create_native_tls_connector` / `create_rustls_connector` per feature |
| `chia-ssl` | `ChiaCertificate` |
| `chia-traits` | `Streamable` |
| `chia_streamable_macro` | `streamable` (proc macro) |
| DIG extensions | `DigMessage`, `DigMessageType`, `UnknownDigMessageType`, `RegisterPeer`, `RegisterAck`, `RequestPeersIntroducer`, `RespondPeersIntroducer` |

Removing or changing the signature/semantics of any re-exported or DIG-extension item is
a breaking change to every consumer; additions are non-breaking.

## 7. Features and configuration

| Feature | Default | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `native-tls` | off | forwards to `chia-sdk-client/native-tls`; enables `Client`, `ClientState`, `Connector`, `create_native_tls_connector` |
| `rustls` | off | forwards to `chia-sdk-client/rustls`; enables `Client`, `ClientState`, `Connector`, `create_rustls_connector` |

With neither feature the crate MUST still build; only the TLS-dependent re-exports are
absent. Consumers select a TLS backend on `dig-peer-protocol` rather than depending on
`chia-sdk-client` directly.

The crate has no runtime configuration; it defines types only.

## 8. Security properties

- **Transport security is inherited, not defined here.** Peer connections use Chia's
  mutual-TLS model via the re-exported `chia-sdk-client` connectors and
  `chia-ssl::ChiaCertificate`; this crate adds no cryptography of its own.
- **Decode safety:** `DigMessage::from_bytes`, `DigMessage::from_bytes_owned`, and the
  `from_dig_message` decoders MUST never panic or over-read on malformed input
  (truncated buffers → `None`; corrupt bodies → `Err`; oversized `data_len` → `None`;
  offset arithmetic overflow → `None`, never a panic or wrap). `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`
  is enforced crate-wide (Cargo `[lints.rust]`).
- **No trust in payloads:** the framing layer imposes no semantic validation on `data`;
  consumers MUST validate decoded payloads before acting on them.

## 9. Compatibility invariants

1. **Framing is frozen.** The §2.1 byte layout is byte-identical to
   `chia_protocol::Message` and MUST NOT change.
2. **Opcode registry is append-only.** Assigned values 200–219 (§3.2) are permanent;
   new opcodes extend the band upward, never reuse or renumber.
3. **Payload encodings are append-compatible per Chia Streamable rules** — the
   `RegisterPeer`/`RegisterAck` field lists (§4) are fixed; any evolution must keep old
   encodings decodable.
4. **Serde form is the wire value.** `DigMessageType` JSON/serde representation stays
   the raw integer discriminant.

## 10. Conformance summary

| # | Requirement | Verified by |
|---|-------------|-------------|
| C1 | Frame layout `[u8 type][u8 has_id][u16 id?][u32 len][data]`, big-endian, matches `chia_protocol::Message` | §2.1; round-trip + boundary tests in `src/dig_message.rs` |
| C2 | Decoder accepts any opcode; truncated input → `None`, never panic; `data_len` above `MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE` (16 MiB) → `None` before slicing/allocating; offset arithmetic is overflow-checked on every target width | §2.2; truncation + oversized-length + overflow tests in `src/dig_message.rs` |
| C3 | DIG band is exactly 200–219; dispatch boundary at 200 | §3.1–3.2; range tests in `src/dig_message_type.rs`, boundary test in `src/dig_message.rs` |
| C4 | `TryFrom<u8>` rejects every non-assigned value with `UnknownDigMessageType` | §3.3; `unknown_rejected` test |
| C5 | `DigMessageType` serde = raw u8 discriminant | §3.4; serde tests in `src/dig_message_type.rs` |
| C6 | `RegisterPeer` = (`ip: String`, `port: u16`, `node_type: NodeType`) at opcode 218; `RegisterAck` = (`success: bool`) at 219; wrong opcode → `None`, corrupt body → `Err`; `success=false` is valid | §4; round-trip + decode-error tests in `src/introducer_wire.rs` |
| C7 | Opcodes 63/64 remain Chia-`ProtocolMessageTypes`-compatible `#[streamable(message)]` types | §5; streamable round-trip tests |
| C8 | Re-export surface of §6 available from `dig_peer_protocol` alone; TLS items gated by `native-tls`/`rustls` | §6–7; `src/lib.rs` |
| C9 | `unsafe_code` denied; no panics on malformed wire input | §8; `Cargo.toml` lints, decode tests |

Peer implementations (any language) MUST reproduce C1–C6 byte-for-byte to interoperate
with DIG nodes. The gossip layer consuming these opcodes and the introducer/relay
services are specified in their own repositories; the DIG Network protocol documentation
at docs.dig.net covers the network-level behavior built on these messages.
